/**
 * #6278 (plan item 1.4): a preparation read that can wait on a relation lock
 * ends at the budget on the server, not only in this process.
 *
 * Preparation reads run outside the publication transaction, and through a
 * transaction-mode pooler the session's `statement_timeout` startup parameter
 * is dropped, so an `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock on `pages` held in another
 * session pinned the member's statement, and its connection, for as long as
 * the lock lasted: the budget released the claim, but the statement kept
 * running as a zombie and the root stayed blocked until the hard ceiling.
 * `boundedReads` wraps the preparer's engine so every unmemoized raw
 * statement runs with `executeRaw`'s `timeoutMs` set to the time the clock
 * has left (`deadlineAt`), a transaction-local `statement_timeout` that holds
 * through the pooler. A statement the server ends for it (57014 statement
 * timeout, or a 55P03 lock timeout a shorter session `lock_timeout` raised)
 * surfaces as the member's own `preparation_deadline`, so the consumer
 * releases the claim charged instead of writing a `storage_error` receipt or
 * an uncounted `database_contention` release.
 *
 * The memo rule stands: a read `preparationReads` answers once for a whole
 * group never takes one member's bound or signal (group-publish.ts drops
 * them), and a statement that already carries a caller's signal keeps the
 * foreground path's cancellation instead of the bound. Engine helpers that bypass `executeRaw`
 * (`readPageSnapshot` and the import pipeline) stay under the consumer's race
 * and the ceiling. Without a deadline (switch off, a clock from an older
 * caller) or on PGLite (one in-process connection, no other session to wait
 * on) the engine is returned as it is.
 *
 * #6317 (C1): the same wrapper records each statement's label on the clock
 * (`recordClaimSql`) before issuing it, so the claim stamp's `last_sql` names
 * the read a parked preparation is waiting on.
