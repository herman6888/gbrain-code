/**
 * The vector-search statement, built once for both engines, the doctor
 * `vector_plan` check and the plan-proof E2E so the SQL they run or EXPLAIN
 * can never drift (#5824).
 *
 * Content freshness (`embedded_text_hash = md5(chunk_text)`) is an expression
 * Postgres has no statistics for. Inside the HNSW candidate CTE the planner
 * estimates it at 0.5% selectivity, expects to walk most of the index for
 * `ORDER BY embedding <=> $q LIMIT n`, and picks a sequential scan that hits
 * the vector deadline on large brains. On an HNSW-indexed column the
 * candidate CTE therefore carries only the well-estimated model check
 * (relaxed variant); freshness is projected as `hash_current` and filtered in
 * `scored`, so a stale-text chunk still never reaches results. The guarded
 * variant (freshness inside the CTE) serves non-indexed columns, the legacy
 * guard rollback, the exact fallback and the `hasMore` exhaustion witness.
 *
 * `candidate_pool` counts raw candidate rows (a full raw window escalates, a
 * short one means the index ran dry); `eligible_pool` counts the fresh ones
 * and is what `hasMore` compares against its guarded count.
 *
 * `indexWalkSql` (relaxed variant only) runs first. Even with freshness out
 * of the CTE, the joined statement's plan sits on a cost knife edge: TOASTed
 * vectors make a sequential scan look cheap, the HNSW estimate grows with
 * `hnsw.ef_search` (the window), and the private-page rule's correlated
 * subplans price every page lookup so high that the planner filters all
 * pages up front. A 25k-chunk brain flips to a full scan, sort and
 * nested-loop join at a 50-row limit or on any remote read. The index walk
 * orders `content_chunks` alone (`ann`, chunk-level filters only, twice the
 * window, scaled by 1/share for a source scope), then joins pages and
 * sources by key and applies every page filter to those rows, keeping the
 * nearest `innerLimit` eligible ones: the same set the joined statement
 * selects whenever that many survive. Callers run it with sorting disabled so
 * the HNSW scan is the only ordered path, accept it when its window is full,
 * and otherwise run the joined statement as before, whose plans stay with the
 * planner for selective filters. A type or date filter skips the walk: it is
 * an explicit narrowing that usually leaves the window short, so the walk
 * would only add its cost. So does a source scope whose share of pages
 * (`pages.source_id` planner statistics, `scope.share`) is below
 * INDEX_WALK_MIN_SCOPE_SHARE: the nearest chunks overall rarely fill its
 * window.
 *
 * `scopeScanSql` serves a source scope under SCOPE_SCAN_MAX_SHARE of pages
 * whose estimated chunk count (`scope.chunks`, the share times
 * `content_chunks` reltuples) is at most SCOPE_SCAN_MAX_CHUNKS: an exact
 * distance scan over the scope's chunks with every filter applied, ordering
 * only chunk ids (`+ 0` keeps the index out), then the window joins back for
 * its columns. The eligible page ids come first as `= ANY(ARRAY(...))`, so
 * chunks are always reached through `idx_chunks_page`: joined inline, the
 * private-page rule's estimate flipped the scan to a sequential scan of every
 * chunk with a nested-loop join filter and ran the rule once per chunk
 * (1.1 s for a 40k-chunk scope at 50k pages, 9-22 s for a 74k-chunk one). It is complete by construction, where a filtered HNSW scan of
 * a mid-share scope returned a fraction of the true neighbours, and it costs
 * a few microseconds per scope chunk. Up to SCOPE_SCAN_FIRST_MAX_CHUNKS it
 * replaces the walk; above that the walk runs first (fast when the scope's
 * chunks spread through the space) and the scan answers when the walk comes
 * back short, as it does for a scope clustered away from the query. Callers
 * accept the scan when it fills the limit or its window is short (the scope
 * ran out of eligible chunks).
